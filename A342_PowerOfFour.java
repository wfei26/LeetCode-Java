     * the additional restriction is that in binary form, the only "1" should always located at the odd position.
     * For example, 4^0 = 1, 4^1 = 100, 4^2 = 10000. So we can use "num & 0x55555555==num" to check if "1" is located
     * at the odd position.
     *
     *  0x55555555 is a hexametrical numberï¼Œit is 1010101010101010101010101010101 in binary with a length of 32.
     *  To make sure the 1 locates in the odd location.
